# Master-thesis_Solveig_Halldora_Stefansdottir
The code utilized within the Master thesis of Solveig Halldora Stefansdottir. The code utilizes inheritance of Porepy framework, 
specifically referring to the version dated January 14th, 2023.

We have two code verifications and three different simulations: 
 * Simulation 1: A single tilted fracture in a homogeneous medium
 * Simulation 2: Many tilted fractures in a homogeneous medium
 * Simulation 3: Many tilted fracture in a layered media
